## Background

The Trump administration recently recommended free market and competition as a remedy to America's healthcare problems.  One recommendation was to eliminate non-compete agreements between doctors and their employers.  Non-compete agreements are disfavored in the law, with most jurisdictions placing limitations on the time period  and on the geographic boundaries.  Approximately eight states either outright ban non-compete agreements or place restrictions on their use with regard to physicians.  One survey estimated that 45% of doctors are bound by such an agreement.
