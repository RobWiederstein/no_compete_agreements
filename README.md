## Physician Non-compete Agreements in Healthcare

In a [report](reference/2018-11-30-reforming_us_healthcare_through_choice_competition.pdf) entitled, "Reforming the America's Healthcare System Through Choice and Competition, the Trump administration made several recommendations as a remedy to America's healthcare problems.  One recommendation was to eliminate non-compete agreements between doctors and their employers.


>Various reports on non-compete clauses have also suggested that they are overly
burdensome and restrictive on providers. Further scrutiny of these and other restrictive
covenants is warranted, particularly where they impede patient access to care and limit the
supply of providers. By suppressing competition, these clauses may inflate healthcare
prices, elevating patient and federal spending on healthcare goods and services.

The report then recommended that "states should scrutinize restrictive covenants such as non-compete clauses, particularly their impact on patient access to care and on the supply of providers."

Non-compete agreements are disfavored in the law, with most jurisdictions placing limitations on the time period  and on the geographic boundaries.  Approximately eight states either outright ban non-compete agreements or place restrictions on their use with regard to physicians.  One survey estimated that 45% of doctors are bound by such an agreement.  

A physician shortage is in the offing with many organizations sounding the alarm.  In an [article](reference/2018-05-02_usa_today_physician_shortage.pdf) in the USA Today, the Association of American Medical Colleges is projecting a "shortfall of between 42,600 and 121,300 physicians by 2030."
