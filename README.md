## Physician Non-compete Agreements in Healthcare

In a [report](reference/2018-11-30-reforming_us_healthcare_through_choice_competition.pdf) entitled, "Reforming the America's Healthcare System Through Choice and Competition, the Trump administration made several recommendations as a remedy to America's healthcare problems.  One recommendation was to eliminate non-compete agreements between doctors and their employers.  Non-compete agreements are disfavored in the law, with most jurisdictions placing limitations on the time period  and on the geographic boundaries.  Approximately eight states either outright ban non-compete agreements or place restrictions on their use with regard to physicians.  One survey estimated that 45% of doctors are bound by such an agreement.
